    "The curse of dimenionzlity refers to various challenge that arise when dealing with high-dimensional data.In machine learning ,it manfiest as increased computaional complexity sparsity of data and overfitting issues it important because it affect the performance and efficency of many algorthims making it harder to anyalze and model high-dimensional data accurately.Technique like dimensionallty reduction and feature slection are often employed to mitigate its effect"
